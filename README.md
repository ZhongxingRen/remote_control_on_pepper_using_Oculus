# remote_control_on_pepper_using_Oculus
  My purpose to establish this repo is to record the remote control function on pepper, I put pepper, ip cam, manipulation computer, under a same local area network.
  
  The main purpose to develop this function is to let the remote customer have a realistic feeling of shopping through the VR techniques, to attain this, it is unevidable to use some pepper remote control apis for keyboard teleoperation.  


  Because of the limited upload size of github, I personally share a link of a unity package to help you download the unity package to have a control of ip cam which was placed on the pepper:
