# remote_control_on_pepper_using_Oculus
  My purpose to establish this repo is to record the remote control function on pepper, I put pepper, ip cam, manipulation computer, under a same local area network. 
  The main purpose to develop this function is to let the remote customer have a realistic feeling of shopping through the VR techniques, to attain this, it is unevidable to use some pepper remote control apis for keyboard teleoperation.
